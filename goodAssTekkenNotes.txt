Introducing Firebase Realtime Database lets you keep track of user entities yourself - this lets you associate things such as messages, invoices, books, etc. to users while Firebase handles the sensitive data. You can also migrate Firebase Realtime Database to Cloud Firestore.

Firebase manages user authentication but you handle user entities.

Note: You can use indexes for faster queries

Your realtime database is currently set to TEST mode, allowing all reads and writes during development.

Implementing Firebase Realtime Database
---
Initialize database API in Firebase class constructor (just like the authentication API)
Extend class interface by adding User API logic that lets you retrieve references to individual users via UserID as well as references to all users.
    Firebase paths follow REST philosophy where every user is associated with a URI.

Firebase Realtime Database Info:
    Data stored as JSON and synced realtime
    After you finish testing your app, read the Firebase Realtime Database Rules and create your own rules
    Can view database in Firebase console
    

Read or write data from a database:
    To do this, you need an instance of firebase.database.reference (async listener)
        You attach the listener and it's ran once for initial data and again anytime data changes
    set() lets you save and replace data at a specific reference
    on() or once() to read data at a path and listen for changes
        once() lets you snapshot data once w/o listening to changes
    value event lets you read and listen for any changes to any content in a path
        Retrieve daa in the snapshot in the val() method
    Updating and deleting data done w/ update() and remove()
    Data is written locally before being written to the database, allowing for database writes to happen after connection is regained post-loss.

Good Ass Tekken User Management
---
    Goal: Creating and getting users from Firebase Realtime Database
        Add user creation to  signup so users can be created and saved after signup is successful
            Done by adding a first .then() promise which creates the user in your firebase database before the second .then()
            callback which sets the state back to the initial states and reroutes to home page.
                What this now does is it creates a user in firebase's inteernal auth database
                and if this is successful, it creates a user in firebase's realtime Database
                    uses firebase class reference by providing the uid of the user from the auth database
                    basically, it uses the auth user database ID to create a user in the realtime database
        DO NOT store sensitive user info such as passwords, etc. in your realtime database

Admin component a good place for logic to retrieve info from all users
Retrieve all the users in admin componentDidMount()
Needs to be a class component to keep track of users and loading
    users empty object
    loading set to false in initial state but changed to true in first line of componentDidMount which makes sense
    Because the users are objects instead of lists when retrieved from Firebase Realtime DB,
    it's a lot more convenient to convert the users object into a state array
    A LOT easier to use arrays than objects to display information.
    YOU'RE MAKING AN ARRAY OF OBJECTS!! OHHHH.
Remove the listener when the component unmounts

So the million dollar question of the day is...where do I take the development of this application?
I think that for starters, I should define the baseline MVP.
MVP for Good Ass Tekken:

User sign up with captcha. The intention of this captcha is used to stop bots.
Alright, so now we will look into reCAPTCHA.
    reCAPTCHA protects sites from spam and abuse from bots while allowing human usage!
    Can be added to your site w/ firebase hosting + cloud functions for firebase.

After user signs up, they have the freedom to be able to upload matches onto the website. Other features will be TBD of course, but I think that the ability to simply just Add Matches is
the most important thing to focus on.
This means that I would have to create a basic form which I can use to add matches.
What search options do I use?
    Match Conditions: Tournament / Casuals / Deathmatch
    Event Name
    Characters
    Winning Characters
    Players
    Winning Player
    Stage Conditions: Walls / Infinite / Both

When user uploads the match, what happens?
    It should be able to be searched for immediately
        Okay.
    Where does the user get redirected to, if they even do? How are they notified of a successful upload?
        Notification that gives them the option to either:
            1. Submit another video
            2. Return to homepage
Searching
    How do users search for a match?
