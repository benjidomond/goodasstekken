Introducing Firebase Realtime Database lets you keep track of user entities yourself - this lets you associate things such as messages, invoices, books, etc. to users while Firebase handles the sensitive data. You can also migrate Firebase Realtime Database to Cloud Firestore.

Firebase manages user authentication but you handle user entities.

Note: You can use indexes for faster queries

Your realtime database is currently set to TEST mode, allowing all reads and writes during development.

Implementing Firebase Realtime Database
---
Initialize database API in Firebase class constructor (just like the authentication API)
Extend class interface by adding User API logic that lets you retrieve references to individual users via UserID as well as references to all users.
    Firebase paths follow REST philosophy where every user is associated with a URI.
